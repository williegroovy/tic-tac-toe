Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The challenge was pretty straight forward.

Biggest hurdle was simplifying the logic required to decided if there is a winner.
 
I tried to structure my data in a way that is a very easy mapping over to the UI assets to avoid
a ton of duplication and tech debt.

The game is functional and I was able to add a few extra things to make up for my lack "design skills".
